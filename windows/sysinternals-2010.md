# Microsoft Sysinternals Suite: 2010 version

## Description
This is an old 32 bit version of the Microsoft Sysinternals Suite downloaded 
from archive.org to ensure compatibility with 32-bit Windows XP.


## Usage
From the command line, run the tool you need.  The first time each program 
runs, it will prompt you to accept a license in a GUI window.

Useful tools
* PSFile - Open files
* PSLoggedOn - Active remote login sessions
* PSList - Running processes
* PSServcie - Running services

The tools may not terminate their output with end-of-file, so if the command 
prompt does not return after ten seconds, stop it with `Ctrl + C`.


## Review
The GUI popup is annoying, but these tools provide very useful functionality 
beyond what the Windows command prompt provides.


## Location
These executables are included in the windows-xp tools image.
